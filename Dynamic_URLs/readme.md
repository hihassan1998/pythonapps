# Flask Project - Servers,URLS & RESTFUL Apis
Welcome to the second installment of my Flask project! In this phase, we'll delve into the intricacies of Flask as we explore routes, handle HTTP requests, and build a small yet robust RESTful API. As a cherry on top, we'll also be implementing application-level error handlers to gracefully manage common errors like 404 NOT FOUND and 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR.
